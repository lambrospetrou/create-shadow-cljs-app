Node.js example with ClojureScript with [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs)
----

- [Shadow-cljs](http://shadow-cljs.org/)
- [Integrate with NPM modules](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#npm)
- [ClojureScript cheatsheet](https://cljs.info/cheatsheet/)

### Develop

Install all dependencies.

```bash
npm run install
```

Watch compile with with hot reloading, using the `browser` target as example.

```
npm run watch:browser
```

The above command will also start a server at port `5000` so that you can open `http://localhost:5000` and load the website.

### Production release

Build production builds for each target.

```bash
# Build all targets
npm run release
# or
npm run release:app
npm run release:library
npm run release:browser
```

#### Browser

```bash
# Build the JS bundle
npm run release:browser

# Serve the demo at http://localhost:5000
npm run start:browser
```

This will generate a file inside `build/browser/browser-main.js`, and use it from the generated `build/browser/index.html` which loads the script.

The `browser-main.js` file contains your JavaScript logic, so copy that into your server and load it into your main website HTML. See the provided `src/_build_hooks/index.html` as an example.

#### Node application

```
npm run release:app
```

Compiles the Node app, `:app` target, to `build/node-app.js`.

You can run your app/script by running `node build/node-app.js`.

#### Library

Apart from the main Node script/app generated, we can also generate a library in the standard `commonjs` format that can be used in other Node/JavaScript projects, or as a handler in AWS Lambda.

```
npm run release:library
```

You can test the library generated by running the default AWS Lambda handler provided:

```
node -e 'require("./build/lib.js").handler({"a": 10}, null, (_, result) => console.log(JSON.stringify(result)))'
```

- [Multiple named exports](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_multiple_static_named_exports)

### REPL

Start a REPL connected to current running program, `app` for the `:build-id`:

```bash
npx shadow-cljs cljs-repl app
```
